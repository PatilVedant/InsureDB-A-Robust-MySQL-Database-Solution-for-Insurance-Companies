the details of their existing claims, allows customers and administrators to connect with one
another. Logging in, reviewing customer requests, and accepting or deny them. Each
customer and Admin have unique login credentials. A new customer can sign up by putting a

will be rejeccted/accepted by the admin, The customer can see his pending request which the
customer has made in past. Customer can also see the request which are declined by the

There are certain companies in the insurance sector with modern insurance claim portals for
clients and employees. However, several new, modestly sized insurance startups do not yet
have fully functional claim handling systems. They contain too many features and functions,
which makes it more difficult to navigate the website and may result in several errors. As a
result, we have made an effort to create a claim management system that is simple and easy to
use for both customers and employees.
